# Portfolio

1. Demonstrate your understanding of your site's audience
2. Demonstrate the design decisions made
3. Demonstrate that you considered usability heuristics
4. Any wireframes
5. Style guide
6. Personal Logo

### Audience
The project is directed to the attention of prospective employers and for this reason has to reflect my personality and skills while being professional and concise.
I decided to implent a pleasant casual working environment background with my picture and a short description as well as a greeting.

### Tools
To achieve my goal I made use of the following tools:
* VsCode
* Figma
* Github
* Netlify

And the following resources:
* Codepen
* Google
* Stack Overflow
* Css-tricks
* W3schools.com

### Inspiration
To get started and get an idea of how my portfolio would look like I googled other web developers websites and selected a few that I liked either for design or features. I also made a moodboard and build a color palette. Finally I picked a background for the home page from "unsplash".

### Design
I decided to use a background image as the homepage for my portfolio website. I modified the background in figma and added a profile picture and a short description and greeting. 
I divided the website in 4 section:
* Home
* Projects
* Cv
* Contac me
##### Navbar
I decided to implement a fixed hidden navbar at the top for easy mobile access and switch to a hoverable side hidden navbar for larger devices.
##### Projects
This section includes a list of my projects with a screenshot and a brief description as well as a link to the github repository
##### Cv
I decided to include a interactive cv so that the prospective employers would be able to have a quick glance before downloading the pdf format provided.
##### Contact me
At the end of the website I included a contact form as well as the links to my Github, Linkedin, Codepen and Twitter profiles.

### Responsive Design
This is a mobile first website, with easy navigation through scrolling and top navbar. I used a wrapper to make sure the main content is centered at all times and doesn't expand too much when the page is resized. In fact I also included a maximum width to avoid breaking the design on bigger desktop devices. I used flexbox on the projects section to manage the positioning of the projects across different devices.
The navbar, which is fixed and clickable on a mobile becomes a hoverable sidebar on bigger devices.

### Approach
I utilized a 4 colors palette throughout the design and styled the sections accordingly. As for the animation/navbar animation I decided to follow a pure Css approach. With the use of a hidden checkbox I simulated the click on the navbar and displayed the content of the cv buttons.

### Problems
I encountered several problems during the process.
### Design problems
Finding the right colour palette that would match the backgournd I chose. Deciding what kind of navbar to use and wether a navbar for the mobile version was needed. The use of the colours with the different sections and controls.
### Technical problems
Trying to find a way to implement a pure css navbar hasn't been easy, and I had to fix a lot of bugs and trying to build my own solution from different sources.
